## Frequently Asked Questions
>Q: "How do I texture the tail?"
>A: "Using your favorite image editor, preferably one that can retain transparency of PNGs. If you are having a hard time understanding how to texture, treat this similar to editing a minecraft skin!"

>Q: "How do I add fins/change the size of the tail?"
>A: "Figura uses Blockbench for its avatar models, I recommend looking up a tutorial on using blockbench, however, I recommend looking into learning how to make flat planes.

>Q: "My emissive/glowing texture isn't working/working incorrectly!"
>A: "Make sure the emissive texture of choice `<Texture Name>_e.png` has the part you want glowing. If the tail isnt glowing correctly, add the new/modified part to the `GlowingTail.lua` script's `glowPart` table. Follow [model indexing](https://wiki.figuramc.org/tutorials/ModelPart%20Indexing) patterns!

>Q: "How do I modify the animations?"
>A: "This Avatar uses Blockbench for its animations, however, most use a custom lua based molang with a tick based timer for its sine waves. If you do not understand sinewaves, try messing with the values around the [sine equations](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/w9jrdpvsmk)!"

>Q: "Why does `x` part/feature exist?"
>A: "Various parts/features exist for the sake of streamlined customizeability. If you feel that a feature is not needed, removing it should be easy, but will most likely result in a script error. Deleting associated code should fix the issue."
